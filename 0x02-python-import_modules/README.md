# Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

# General
Why Python programming is awesome
How to import functions from another file
How to use imported functions
How to create a module
How to use the built-in function dir()
How to prevent code in your script from being executed when imported
How to use command line arguments with your Python programs
Copyright - Plagiarism
You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks below yourself to meet with the above learning objectives.
You will not be able to meet the objectives of this or any following project by copying and pasting someone elseâ€™s work.
You are not allowed to publish any content of this project.
Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.

# Requirements
## General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc

0-add.py - a program that imports the function def add(a, b): from the file add_0.py and prints the result of the addition 1 + 2 = 3

You have to use print function with string format to display integers
You have to assign:
the value 1 to a variable called a
the value 2 to a variable called b
and use those two variables as arguments when calling the functions add and print
a and b must be defined in 2 different lines: a = 1 and another b = 2
Your program should print: <a value> + <b value> = <add(a, b) value> followed with a new line
You can only use the word add_0 once in your code
You are not allowed to use * for importing or __import__
Your code should not be executed when imported - by using __import__, like the example below

1-calculation.py - a program that imports functions from the file calculator_1.py, does some Maths, and prints the result.

Do not use the function print (with string format to display integers) more than 4 times
You have to define:
the value 10 to a variable a
the value 5 to a variable b
and use those two variables only, as arguments when calling functions (including print)
a and b must be defined in 2 different lines: a = 10 and another b = 5
Your program should call each of the imported functions. See example below for format
the word calculator_1 should be used only once in your file
You are not allowed to use * for importing or __import__
Your code should not be executed when imported

2-args.py - a program that prints the number of and the list of its arguments.

The output should be:
Number of argument(s) followed by argument (if number is one) or arguments (otherwise), followed by
: (or . if no arguments were passed) followed by
a new line, followed by (if at least one argument),
one line per argument:
the position of the argument (starting at 1) followed by :, followed by the argument value and a new line
Your code should not be executed when imported
The number of elements of argv can be retrieved by using: len(argv)
You do not have to fully understand lists yet, but imagine that argv can be used just like a C array: you can use an index to walk through it. There are other ways (which will be preferred for future project tasks), if you know them you can use them.

3-infinite_add.py - a program that prints the result of the addition of all arguments

The output should be the result of the addition of all arguments, followed by a new line
You can cast arguments into integers by using int() (you can assume that all arguments can be casted into integers)
Your code should not be executed when imported
