0-square_matrix_simple.py -  a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix.

Prototype: def square_matrix_simple(matrix=[]):
matrix is a 2 dimensional array
Returns a new matrix:
Same size as matrix
Each value should be the square of the value of the input
Initial matrix should not be modified
You are not allowed to import any module
You are allowed to use regular loops, map, etc.

1-search_replace.py -  a function that replaces all occurrences of an element by another in a new list.

Prototype: def search_replace(my_list, search, replace):
my_list is the initial list
search is the element to replace in the list
replace is the new element
You are not allowed to import any module

5-number_keys.py -  a function that returns the number of keys in a dictionary.

Prototype: def number_keys(a_dictionary):
You are not allowed to import any module

7-update_dictionary.py -  a function that replaces or adds key/value in a dictionary.

Prototype: def update_dictionary(a_dictionary, key, value):
key argument will be always a string
value argument will be any type
If a key exists in the dictionary, the value will be replaced
If a key doesn’t exist in the dictionary, it will be created
You are not allowed to import any module

8-simple_delete.py -  a function that deletes a key in a dictionary.

Prototype: def simple_delete(a_dictionary, key=""):
key argument will be always a string
If a key doesn’t exist, the dictionary won’t change
You are not allowed to import any module

9-multiply_by_2.py - a function that returns a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2

Prototype: def multiply_by_2(a_dictionary):
You can assume that all values are only integers
Returns a new dictionary
You are not allowed to import any module

10-best_score.py - a function that returns a key with the biggest integer value.

Prototype: def best_score(a_dictionary):
You can assume that all values are only integers
If no score found, return None
You can assume all students have a different score
You are not allowed to import any module

10-best_score.py -  a function that returns a key with the biggest integer value.

Prototype: def best_score(a_dictionary):
You can assume that all values are only integers
If no score found, return None
You can assume all students have a different score
You are not allowed to import any module

11-multiply_list_map.py - a function that returns a list with all values multiplied by a number without using any loops.

Prototype: def multiply_list_map(my_list=[], number=0):
Returns a new list:
Same length as my_list
Each value should be multiplied by number
Initial list should not be modified
You are not allowed to import any module
You have to use map
Your file should be max 3 lines
